Made with ❤️ using pure HTML and CSS by [n.shravya]

### 1. HTML5
**HyperText Markup Language (HTML)** is the standard language for creating web pages. In this project:
- It provides the structure and content of the portfolio.
- Elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, and semantic tags are used to define the layout.
- It includes anchor tags (`<a>`) for navigation and `<img>` for images.

### 2. CSS3
**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** handles the presentation and design. In this project:
- It styles the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness.
- Media queries are used to make the design responsive for different screen sizes.
- Flexbox or CSS Grid is used to align and space elements.
- Pseudo-classes like `:hover` are used for interactive effects.
- Transitions and animations are applied to enhance user experience.
